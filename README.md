# null-keys

null-keys is a small cache of AutoHotkey scripts i've either written or collected, and compiled into a personal "universal" script that provides useful conveniences, or just some fun functionality.

## Installation / Usage

clone or download the repo, and launch null-keys.ahk

## Features

- remaps CapsLock to Escape
- also uses CapsLock as new modifier key (see hotkeys.ahk)
  - CapsLock + E = edit script in default editor
  - CapsLock + R = reload script
  - CapsLock + D/F/G/T = launch or switch to apps (see funcs.ahk)
  - CapsLock + (select area with mouse) = take screenshot (ctrl+s to save, double-click to close)
  - CapsLock + P = always-on-top, borderless sticky note (ctrl+s to save, ctrl+l to reload, MButton to close)
  - CapsLock + Enter = task manager
  - CapsLock + Del = empty recycle bin
  - ...and more
- when editing script in any(?) editor, Ctrl+S to save will automagically reload script!
- mouse wheel over tray/taskbar adjusts system volume
- tea timer, with notifications and progress bar!
- Warframe "Zenurik Energizing Dash" script
- some fun emoticon hotkeys
- whatever else i decide to toss in

## Feedback
