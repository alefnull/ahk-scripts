# ahk-scripts

collection of various AutoHotkey scripts

in the process of setting up version control for my existing scripts, i mistakenly deleted the entire project. so this repo is now a fresh start to build back to what i had before.

## usage

- launch 'autoexec.ahk'
- tweak included scripts as needed
